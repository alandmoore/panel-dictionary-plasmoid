Vesrion 0.1.1 2009-08-23
 * FIXES
   -combo box now acquires focus even when other windows are active (thanks emdek!)
   -python-dictclient output now includes dictionary names for each definition.

Version 0.1 2009-08-21
 * Initial release
 * KNOWN ISSUES:
  - combo box has a hard time acquiring and keeping focus when in the panel, especially when there is a maximized application on screen.
  - text is always black, which doesn't work well with some themes
  - dict dataengine backend is just lacking.  Not really much I can do about this.
  - background sizing issues when moved from the panel
  - I am not happy with the implementation of the definition dialog box.  I had to hack it together because KMessageBox is modal and would lock up Plasma.
